# NLU course projects: Lab. 6 (SA)
This folder contains the work done to solve the **SA task**, in particular to implement model based on Pre-trained Language model for the **Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)** task regarding the extraction of the aspect terms only. *Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)* is a fine-grained form of sentiment analysis that focuses on identifying the sentiment or opinion associated with specific aspects or features of an entity within a text. Unlike traditional sentiment analysis, which provides an overall sentiment, ABSA breaks down sentiment by specific “aspects” or “attributes” (e.g., “camera” in a review of a phone). This allows for a more detailed understanding of what people like or dislike about particular attributes within products, services, or topics

Look at the report [SA.pdf]() for more details.
